👨🏻‍💻  About Me
💡  I'm a Computer Science and ML Engineer who has spent 5+ years building scalable distributed systems and optimisation engines.
🎓  I'm an alumnus of NIT Allahabad. A proud Moti ka lal :D
🎓  I'm currently a postgraduate student studying Artificial Intelligence at the School of Aerospace at Cranfield University.
🛠  My last work project was building NodeIQ at Locus.sh. I have previously worked for Practo.
🌱  The brain fascinates me and you had me at Computational Neuroscience.
🌱  The space is where we are headed, and that just might save us from impending doom.
